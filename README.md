## Issues
1. The shadow utilities provided by the link on the assignment page did not fit the container of the images. It also added a white background-color that broke the layout of the image grid.
2. On the desktop size, the columns begin to spread part from one another. I tried increasing/decreasing the breakpoints but it drastically alters the placement of the images.
3. On the tablet size, I had a difficult time figuring out how to wrap the images at the bottom (column 3) to fill up the empty space on the right.
